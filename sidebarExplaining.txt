Offcanvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled via JavaScript to appear from the left, right, or bottom 
edge of the viewport.
Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are attached to specific elements you toggle, 
and *data* attributes are used to invoke our JavaScript.

Heads up! Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use *margin* or *translate* on an .offcanvas element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.

Offcanvas includes support for a header with a close button and an optional body class for some initial `padding`.

{{< example class="bd-example-offcanvas p-0 bg-light overflow-hidden" >}}

<div class="offcanvas bd-example-offcanvas p-0 bg-dark 

overflow-hidden text-dark offcanvas-start" tabindex="-1" 

id="offcanvas" aria-labelledby="offcanvasLabel">

  <div class="offcanvas-header">

    <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasLabel">
Offcanvas
    </h5>

    <button
	 type="button" 
	class="btn-close text-reset" 
	data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" 
	aria-label="Close" 
    >
     </button>

  </div>

  <div class="offcanvas-body">
    Content for the offcanvas goes here. You can place just about any Bootstrap component or custom elements here.

  </div>
